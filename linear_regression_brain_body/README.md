##Challenge

The challenge for is to use scikit-learn to create a line of best fit for the included 'challenge_dataset'. Then, make a prediction for an existing data point and see how close it matches up to the actual value. Print out the error you get. You can use scikit-learn's [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html) for more help.
